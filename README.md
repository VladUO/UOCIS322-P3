Description: the program is a word game that gives you a list of words and a list of scrambled letters made up of some of those words, you have to try to find 3 from the list words that can be spelled out using the letters given. When you find a word, it is displayed as “found” and is removed from the list of words still available to be found. When you type in a character that is not in the list of scrambled letters, or a combination of letters that cannot be made from the list of scrambled letters, you are informed that this has happened and the input box is automatically cleared for another attempt. When you match a word, you are informed that this has happened and the input box is automatically cleared for another attempt.
